#ðŸŒ¿ LEGO Botanical Collection Website
Final project for CSE 204 Web Development

This is a small site where you can explore LEGO's botanical collection using real-time data from the Rebrickable API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project displays info about sets like part counts, images, and descriptions. Itâ€™s meant for plant lovers, LEGO fans, or anyone curious about how creativity meets code.

Right now itâ€™s simple, but Iâ€™m planning to rebuild it using a web framework like React or Vue to make the experience more dynamic and scalable. I also want to add features like filters, user favorites, and more detailed set pages.

ðŸŒ± Browse. Discover. Appreciate the plastic flora.
